Question:1:Name and handle the exception occured in the following program: 

a=3
 if a<4:
    a=a/(a-3)
     print(a)
code:
a=3
try:
    if a<4:
        a=a/(a-3)
        print(a)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Division by zero...!")        

Question:2:Name and handle the exception occurred in the following program: 
l=[1,2,3]
print(l[3])
code:
try:
    l=[1,2,3]
    print(l[3])
except IndexError:
    print("Index Error..!")

Question:3: What will be the output of the following code:
# Program to depict Raising Exception
try:
    raise NameError("Hi there")  # Raise Error
except NameError:
    print "An exception"
    raise  # To determine whether the exception was raised or not
ans: not raised beacuse
RunTimeError: no actuve excepton to reraise

Question:4:What will be the output of the following code.
 # Function which returns a/b
def AbyB(a , b):
	try:
		c = ((a+b) / (a-b))
	except ZeroDivisionError:
		print "a/b result in 0"
	else:
		print c

# Driver program to test above function
AbyB(2.0, 3.0)
AbyB(3.0, 3.0)
O/P:
-5.0
a/b result in 0

Question:5:Write a program to show and handle following exceptions: 
1. Import Error
2. Value Error
3. Index Error

code1:
try:
    from threading import DEE
    print(DEE)
except ImportError as excp:
    print("ERROR OCCURED: ",excp)
code2:
try:
    d=int(input("enter any value: "))
    print(d)
    
except ValueError as excp:
    print("ERROR OCCURED: ",excp)      
code3:
list=[1,2,3,5,4]
try:
    print(list[7])
except IndexError as excp:
    print("ERROR OCCURED: ",excp) 

        
Question:6:Create a user-defined exception AgeTooSmallError() that warns the user when they have entered age less than 18. The code must keep taking input till the user enters the appropriate age number(less than 18).
class Error(Exception):
    def ageTooSmallError(self, msg):
        print(msg)

d=True
while d:
  try:
     age=int(input("Enter your age: "))
     if age<18:
         raise Error()

  except Error as e:
     e.ageTooSmallError("NOTE:Age is less than 18")
   
  else:
     d=False
