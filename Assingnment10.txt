Question:1:Create a threading process such that it sleeps for 5 seconds and then prints out a message.
import time
import threading
from threading import *
def first():
    i=1
    while(i<=3):
        print("hey")
        time.sleep(5)
        print("bye")
        i=i+1
def fun():
    t1=Thread(target=first)
    t1.start()
fun()

Question:2:Make a thread that prints numbers from 1-10, waits for 1 sec between
import time
import threading
from threading import Thread
class number:
    def pr_num(self):
        for i in range (1,11):
            print(i)
            time.sleep(1)
def fun():
    ob=number()
    t=Thread(target=ob.pr_num,name="DKSHA")
    t.start()
fun()

Question:3:Make a list that has 5 elements.Create a threading process that prints the 5 elements of the list with a delay of multiple of 2 sec between each display.
Delay goes like 2sec-4sec-6sec-8sec-10sec.
import time
import threading
from threading import Thread

list=[1,2,3,4,5]

def fun():
   delay=2
   for i in list:
      print(i)
      time.sleep(delay)
      delay+=2
def fun_fun():
    t1=Thread(target=fun).start()
fun_fun()

Question:4:Call factorial function using thread.
import time
import threading
from threading import Thread
import math
def fact():
    x=int(input("Enter the num: "))
    print ("Factorial is: ",math.factorial(x))
def fun():
    t=Thread(target=fact)
    t.start()
fun()
